# K-NN
Implemented K-NN(k-nearest neighbors algorithm) without import sklearn.   

# Input:
input_features: It will have dimensions n x d, where n will be number of samples and d will be number of features for each sample.    

num_neighbors: They are the number of neighbors that will be look while determining the class of the input features.    

true_labels: The true label of the features with dimensions n x 1, where n is the number of samples.    

    
# Output:
predicted_class: It will be the list of the class labels for each sample. The dimension of the list will be n x 1, where n will be number of samples.       

f1_score:Weighted F1-Score of the prediction.      

confusion_matrix = confusion matrix.
